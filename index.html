 A leader has to have a vision. Great ones are able to see possibilities and identify opportunities but don’t stop there. Great leaders turn ideas into action.
<br><br>

Leadership means leading a life influence, and a successful one starts with contentment. When an individual is happy with his current life circumstance, he can look at the future without fear that hinders.

Appreciation is a potent source of motivation for people. A leader is able to inspire by acknowledging others’ contribution, and by constantly offering positive and critical feedback.
<br><br>
14 – EMPATHY
Empathy is an enviable trait. One who chooses to see the world through others’ eyes is able to provide support and build a sense of trust. Leaders must understand differing perspectives and needs, and work at being socially sensitive, tactful and perceptive.
<br><br>
15 – NETWORKING
Networking is a requirement in today’s competitive environment. Those who wish to thrive, not just survive, in the arena for the fittest must be bold enough to start something – relationships, deals – and not wait for opportunities to come to them.
